## Server Virtualization Feasibility Analysis
### Objective
Conduct a financial feasibility (cost/benefit) analysis for a server virtualization scenerio. 

### Description
Roleplay as a system administrator for an organization that is attempting to determine if virtualization of its computing server infrastructure would be beneficial to the organization from a financial perspective.

## Executive Summary

### Introduction
IT4U relies heavy on only using physical servers that do not utilize over %25 in average CPU utilization, or a server’s capacity. But with our given server consolidation calculations, IT4U will be able to utilize well-over 80 percent of a server’s capacity and reduce the number of multiple physical servers.  Server consolidation will aid in reducing capital spent on physical servers and at the same time reduce any operational expenses that arise with only having physical servers.
    
### Findings
Two main findings in the 5-year timeline are:
1.	Total cost reduction: IT4U’s current total 5-year estimated cost is $1,152,369,691. While the proposed total 5-year estimated cost is $1,086,286,814. IT4U will save $66,082,876 or 5.7% in 5 years. 
2.	Operational Costs/Soft Costs: IT4U’s current 5-year estimated operational cost is $1,098,247,625. While the proposed 5-year cost is $891,423,457. IT4U will save 18.8% in 5 years. 

### Potential Drawbacks
The only drawback is:
1.	The hard costs increased $140,741,291 due to the purchase of the machines, virtual software, training, and its new maintenance costs. But in the 5-year total costs, these hard costs start to balance out after the first year of purchasing.

### Recommendation
Given the above points, I recommend transitioning to the virtualized infrastructure because given the 5-year timeline, IT4U will save %5.7 in total costs. Therefore, I conclude that this analysis is feasible, and the project should move forward.
